# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is an **Advanced Python Course** repository containing educational materials for intermediate to advanced Python developers. The course covers four core topics essential for professional Python development.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into four main topic directories:

1. **Decorators/** - Contains Day 14 content
   - `14_higher_order_functions.md` - Comprehensive guide to higher-order functions, closures, and decorators
   - Covers functional programming concepts including map, filter, reduce

2. **Exception_Handling/** - Contains Days 15 and 17 content
   - `15_python_type_errors.md` - Python error types and debugging
   - `17_exception_handling.md` - Exception handling patterns, try-except-finally blocks, custom exceptions

3. **Classes_and_Objects/** - Contains Day 21 content
   - `21_classes_and_objects.md` - Object-oriented programming fundamentals
   - Covers classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism

4. **API/** - Contains Day 28 content
   - `28_API.md` - Working with APIs in Python
   - Covers HTTP requests, API consumption, JSON handling

5. **images/** - Contains screenshots and diagrams referenced in the tutorial materials

## Content Structure

Each topic's markdown file follows a consistent educational structure:
- Conceptual introduction
- Detailed explanations with code examples
- Exercises divided into multiple levels (Level 1: basic, Level 2: intermediate, Level 3: advanced)
- Navigation links (some may reference non-existent files from the original template)

## Running Code

This is an educational repository with tutorial content. There are no:
- Test suites
- Build systems
- Package dependencies
- Deployment configurations

To work with code examples:
```bash
# Simply create and run Python files based on the examples
python example.py
```

## Working with This Repository

When adding new content or modifying existing materials:

1. **Maintain consistency**: Follow the existing markdown structure in each topic directory
2. **Keep it focused**: Content should be relevant to the four advanced topics
3. **Preserve images**: The `images/` directory contains visual aids referenced by the tutorials
4. **Educational focus**: Examples should be clear, self-contained, and progressively challenging

## Navigation Notes

- Some navigation links in the markdown files may reference the original "30 Days of Python" structure
- These broken links are remnants of the source material and can be ignored or updated as needed
- The main navigation is in the root `readme.md` file

## Recommended Learning Path

For students using this material, the recommended order is:
1. Classes and Objects (OOP fundamentals)
2. Decorators (functional programming concepts)
3. Exception Handling (error handling and robustness)
4. API Development (practical application)

## Repository Origin

This repository was adapted from the "30 Days of Python" educational series, retaining only the four advanced topics relevant to professional Python development.
